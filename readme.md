# five-ways-to-test

An example project showing different types of test.

The idea of this project is to highlight different methods on how to use tests to developer faster and better.

The presentation bundling this repository, explaining more in detail of what this is about can be found on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ddikman/five-approaches-to-testing).

The principles outligned here are in no way language specific but it is definitely easier to get into, if using a language you are used to.

I hope to reproduce these tests in a number of languages. These sub-folders outline the different methods per language:

- [Python](python/)
